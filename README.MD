Idea:
There are several applications of deep learning to stylize a particular image.  Usually, the user provides an image, selects the style, and then their image is recreated according to that style.  Our goal is slightly different: given paintings of a particular style as input, generate an original painting of a similar style.  For example, if we train on a dataset of impressionist paintings, our net would generate a painting that would pass as an original impressionist painting.
